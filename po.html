      <h4>
        Dhinchak Pooja received media attention after her music videos such as Swag Wali Topi (2015),[7][8] Daaru (2016), Selfie Maine Leli Aaj (2017),[9][10] Dilon Ka Shooter (2017), Baapu Dede Thoda Cash (2017),[11] and Aafreen Fathima Bewafa Hai (2017),[12] received millions of views on YouTube, shortly after their individual releases.[13][11] Her songs have been subject to wide-ranging criticism, and have often been described as part of a new trend of producing cringe-worthy videos to gain web-fame. On 11 June 2017, in response to an individual complaint, YouTube deleted all the song-videos on grounds of privacy violation.[14]
<br><br>
The videos, though have been re-uploaded by other users and continue to be available.[15][16][17] Pooja released a new video after a year in 2019 titled Naach ke Pagal (2019),[18] which she has since deleted from her YouTube channel. In 2020 she uploaded a new song regarding the coronavirus pandemic titled Hoga Na Karona in which she talks about taking precautionary measures to stop the spreading of the disease.[
