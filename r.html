      <h4>
        Round2hell uploaded a video titled "TikTok vs YouTube | The Virus", referencing CarryMinati's viral trend "TikTok vs YouTube". However, the video was taken down due to an alleged copyright strike by Carry. The video broke many of their own video records, and reached 100,000 likes in just 10 minutes of uploading, and also came close to #1 on trending.
        <br><br>
        This gave rise to many controversies, and they uploaded another video apologizing for the misconception that this was because either YouTube or TikTok was offended. It has still not been made clear the reason of the removal of the video.
