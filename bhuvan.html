      <h4>
        In May 2020, Bam uploaded an episode of Titu Talks titled 'Lifeline of Society' in which he interviewed an electrician, house help, farmers, transgenders and milkmen to understand the difficulties they are facing during the COVID-19 lockdown in India.[14] He announced that the earnings from this episode would be used for social causes.
        <br><br> After a month, he revealed on Twitter that the video had generated â‚¹5,20,000, of which the majority of the money was used to provide ration kits, food, and milk to the slums in Delhi NCR. The rest of the money was donated to the farmers' relief fund, sanitary workers, the transgender community, milkmen, community kitchens, dog shelters, and organizations for the blind and migrants
